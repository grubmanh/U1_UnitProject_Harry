  <h1>Unit 1 Final Project<h4> by Harry Grubman</h4></h1>
  <p>Please note that the "Obsessive Camera Direction (OCD)" package is required to run this program.</p>
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This project is a combination of all the concepts learned in Unit 1. It is randomly generated clouds moving with vectors in a generated world. When these clouds get to the edges of the world, they wrap around so that the clouds never leave the sky barren. The clouds are in an array so the number of clouds is easily variable, and hopefully this could be converted to a framework for adding clouds into a future project.</p>
  <h2>Inspiration</h2>
  <p>My inspiration for this project came largely from one of the only games that I've ever played for more than two days called <a href="http://www.busdrivergame.com/">Bus Driver</a>.</p>
  <p>I see this game as a very advanced version of what I think I'll be able to do. Hopefully I will be able to do a very barebones version of it, which can be played by the end of the unit.</p>

  <h2>Future Updates</h2>
  <p>Future updates could include moving objects on the ground, actual white clouds, or other very interesting 3D shapes. Another option is to switch to using vectors for the camera instead of the built in OCD commands.</p>
